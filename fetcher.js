// fecher.js should take two command line arguments:

// a URL
// a local file path
// and downloads the resources at the remote url to the local path
// upon completion, should print out a message about
// downloaded quantity to location.


// There are two operations in this problem which will take an unknown amount of time:

// You need to make an http request and wait for the
// response.
// After the http request is complete, you need to take
//  the data you receive and write it to a file in your local filesystem.

// What if local file already exists?
// Inform is invalid
// Inform if path is invalide
// Inform if url is invalid
